### Introduction to analysis

This analysis is the project of the [Platzi Master](https://platzi.com/master/) Cohort 10 BI group, formed by: [Team](#Our-team). We will use the data published by [Olist](https://olist.com/pt-br/), [Context about the data](#Data).

ðŸ“–We were in a sales department meeting at Olist, after the Data Analysis team made their report on the sales made in Brazil during 2016-2018 they realized that most of the purchases made in e-commerce came from the southeast region of the country, ðŸ˜²astonished, they decide to contact the Business Intelligence team of Plazti Master to answer: **how the socio-economic factor of the population influences the purchase of products through an e-commerce**?
